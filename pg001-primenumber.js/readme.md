## Step1
Function checks whether the given number to be checked is 1. If yes,returns *"1 is neither prime nor composite"*. If not go to **step 2**.
## Step2
Given a variable i such that value of i is 2. check whether i is less than the number to be checked. if yes get inside the loop.
## Step3
check whether reminder of i divided by the given number is zero or not. If it is equal to zero, function will return *false* which consoles *the given number is not a prime number* and increases the value of i by 1 and goto **step2**. else go to **step4**
## Step4
Function will return *true* which consoles *the given number is a prime number.*
