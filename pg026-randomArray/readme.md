# Programming

- first thing to do is understand the problem correctly
- if the problem is complex break it down and take a simplest case
- solve the simplest case
- then generalize
- then optimize

# Programming Languages

javascript, python, golang, java, C/C++, C#, Dart, Rust, Typescript

- Interpreted languages

* Javascript
* Python

- Compiled Languages
  -Native - C/C++, Dart, Rust, golang
  -VM - Java(advantage: programs that runs in windows can be run on linux, because it runs on Java Virtual Machine(JVM) which is common for linux and windows)

- Transpiled Languages

  - Typescript

- Transpiler converts High Level Language into another High Level Language
- Interpreter - takes a HLL and executes it
- Compiler - HLL to executable file on OS

command that can be used to extract strings in terminal from a file
eg: strings /usr/bin/python3.10 |grep <string>

compiled languages execution - eg: gcc foo.c -o foo.out

//Refer javascript.info
