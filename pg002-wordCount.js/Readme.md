## Step1
Function loops through the sentence and checks if element at any index equals *space*. If the condition is satisfied goto **Step 2**

## Step2
if element at a particular index is *space*, then the count which was initialized as zero will increase by 1. goto **step 3**

## Step 3
Function checks if the index i reaches the end of the string. if condition is satisfied, it again increment count by 1 and return the count. else goto step 4

## Step 4
increment the index
